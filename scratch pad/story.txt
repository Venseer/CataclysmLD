Day 3 after Cataclysm

I lay in bed barely asleep. My eyes open quickly and I'm immediately reminded of everything that's happened over the past 3 days.

These horrors came from an abandoned military base long forgotten since the cold war. It was deemed at the time 'too unsafe even in the worst of circumstances'
Surely that was the truth. 3 days was all it took for 99% of the world to die. 3 days to undo thousands of years of progress. 3 days to give us this...

I was one of the lucky ones. I guess... I'm still alive and I managed to make it to an evac center. Most can't say the same. There's only a few of us here now.
They told us to meet here 3 days ago. There were a more of us but some got impatient. A helicopter was supposed to be here 2 days ago. It never came..
Food is running low. We should've been gone by now.

I need to come up with a plan. I need to survive. I will survive... I rise out of bed and get myself ready.
